# Best Practices for Audio Descriptions

This document outlines best practices for creating effective audio descriptions for video content.

## What Makes a Good Audio Description?

Audio descriptions provide access to visual content for people who are blind or have low vision. Effective audio descriptions should:

1. **Be objective**: Describe what is seen without interpretation or bias
2. **Be concise**: Use clear, simple language that fits within available time gaps
3. **Be timely**: Provide descriptions at appropriate moments without overlapping dialogue
4. **Be relevant**: Focus on elements essential to understanding the content
5. **Complement existing audio**: Avoid describing what's already clear from dialogue or sound effects

## Writing Guidelines

### Language and Style

- Use present tense (e.g., "He walks" not "He walked")
- Use active voice when possible
- Be specific about visual elements (colors, sizes, positions)
- Avoid technical jargon unless necessary
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Identify speakers when not obvious from context
- Describe facial expressions and body language that convey emotion

### Content Priorities

When time is limited, prioritize describing:

1. **Changes in setting**: Where and when the scene takes place
2. **Character introductions**: Physical appearance when first seen
3. **Actions and reactions**: What characters do and how they respond
4. **On-screen text**: Signs, titles, subtitles, or other written information
5. **Visual effects**: Important visual elements that advance the story

### Example Transformations

#### ❌ Poor Description
"The man looks sad."

#### ✅ Better Description
"John's shoulders slump as he stares at the floor, tears welling in his eyes."

#### ❌ Poor Description
"The scene is beautiful."

#### ✅ Better Description
"Sunlight filters through autumn leaves, casting golden patterns on the forest floor."

#### ❌ Poor Description
"There's a fight."

#### ✅ Better Description
"Alex dodges a punch, then counters with a swift kick to his opponent's midsection."

## Technical Considerations

### Timing

- Keep descriptions brief enough to fit between dialogue
- For longer descriptions, consider breaking them into multiple segments
- Allow a short pause (0.5-1 second) between the description and subsequent dialogue

### Voice and Delivery

- Use a neutral, clear voice that contrasts with program voices
- Maintain consistent volume relative to the main audio
- Speak at a moderate pace that balances clarity and efficiency
- Use natural intonation, avoiding monotone delivery

### Audio Mixing

- Lower the original audio track slightly during descriptions (ducking)
- Recommended ducking level: -6dB to -10dB
- Fade in/out smoothly to avoid jarring transitions
- Ensure the final mix maintains overall volume consistency

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Accessibility Standards

- In the US, follow guidelines from the DCMP (Described and Captioned Media Program)
- In the UK, follow ITC Guidance on Standards for Audio Description
- For web content, consider WCAG 2.1 guidelines

### Consent and Representation

- Be respectful when describing people's physical characteristics
- Use person-first language when appropriate
- Avoid unnecessary mention of race, disability, or other characteristics unless relevant to understanding the content
- Consider cultural sensitivities in descriptions

## Testing Your Audio Descriptions

Before finalizing your audio descriptions:

1. **Review with timing**: Play the video with descriptions to check timing
2. **Get feedback**: If possible, have someone who is blind or has low vision review
3. **Check comprehension**: Ensure the descriptions provide enough information to understand the content without seeing it
4. **Technical check**: Verify audio quality, volume levels, and file format compatibility
